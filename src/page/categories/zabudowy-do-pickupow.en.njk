        <h3>Improved Functionality and Space Organization</h3>
<p> The canopies are equipped with additional storage compartments in the side doors, allowing you to store smaller, frequently used items that should always be within easy reach. </p>
<p> Dedicated organizers for the side compartments are available as an option. Made from durable material, zippered, and removable, they significantly improve accessibility and help maintain order. </p>
<p> Another option is a camping table mounted internally to the canopy roof. It can be quickly and easily removed, even when the canopy is fully loaded. </p>
<p> Optionally, additional storage compartments can also be installed on the opposite side of the canopy and at the front, on the wall adjacent to the vehicle’s cabin. </p>
<div class="line-x"></div>

<h3>Roof Crossbars and Additional Equipment</h3>
<p> All our canopies are equipped with roof crossbars that allow mounting additional cargo such as a rooftop tent, kayaks, roof boxes, or other accessories. </p>
<p> One of the available options is the installation of a slide-out platform mounted to the truck bed floor. When fully extended, the platform can be tilted to touch the ground, significantly simplifying loading and unloading. </p>

<h3>Materials and Construction</h3>
<div class="line-x"></div>
<p> The canopies are made from a lightweight yet extremely durable aluminum-magnesium alloy. This ensures an unmatched strength-to-weight ratio in its class. </p>

<h3>Technical Specifications</h3>

<h4>Canopy for Smaller Vehicles (Hilux, Ranger, D-Max)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Weight: 62 kg</li>
  <li>Static load capacity: 500 kg</li>
  <li>Dynamic load capacity: 300 kg</li>
</ul>
<div class="line-x"></div>

<h4>Canopy for Larger Vehicles (Dodge Ram, Ford F-150, Toyota Tundra)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Weight: 82 kg</li>
  <li>Static load capacity: 600 kg</li>
  <li>Dynamic load capacity: 350 kg</li>
</ul>
<div class="line-x"></div>

<h3>Alternative Canopy Variants</h3>
<p> In addition to standard full-height canopies aligned with the vehicle’s roofline, we also offer low-profile canopies (half-height versions), as well as bed racks and cargo organizers. </p>
<p> These solutions are designed for users transporting rooftop tents or roof boxes who wish to maintain access to underground garages or reduce overall vehicle height to lower fuel consumption on long journeys. </p>
<p> Our range also includes half-bed organizers intended for transporting smaller loads. A key advantage is the ability to install them without removing the roller shutter, which many modern pickups are equipped with. </p>
<div class="line-x"></div>

<h3>What to Consider Before Purchasing a Pickup Canopy</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Carefully define the intended use of the canopy and any operational limitations. </li>
  <li> If the goal is to maximize cargo space, the tallest canopy version will be the best choice. </li>
  <li> If the canopy is intended for carrying a rooftop tent and total vehicle height matters, consider lower-profile canopies or bed organizers. </li>
  <li> Keep in mind that a heavy canopy, rooftop tent, and additional cargo may exceed the weight at which the suspension operates comfortably. A lightweight canopy, although more expensive, may prevent the need for upgrading to reinforced suspension. </li>
  <li> The assembly and installation method is important. Canopies requiring adhesives or silicone for sealing joints increase the risk of installation errors, leaks, or unwanted residue. </li>
  <li> Every canopy should include a clear installation manual. Its absence can extend assembly time and lead to issues during later use. </li>
  <li> Canopies must be equipped with a third brake light in accordance with regulations, unless the vehicle already has one factory-installed on the tailgate. </li>
</ul>

<p> We encourage you to contact us before purchasing to help select the best solution tailored to your individual needs. </p>
